1. [x] make the application smart to first load dups.toml and apply any dups.user.toml settings
2. [x] introduce command line parameters which will have the highest priority
3. [x] create new log file for each run
4. [x] show progress during a deletion, how many processed so far (M out of N)
5. [x] during a selection, once a folder selected as a "to keep" option, it should be respected all the time (without asking)
6. [x] always show paths in a sorted way during deletion
7. [ ] anything with (number) as a suffix, can be considered a secondary (if they reside in the same folder)

    ```
    1: "/Source/Photos from 2017/_DSC5128(1).JPG"
    2: "/Source/Photos from 2017/_DSC5128.JPG"
    ```

8. [x] After selecting a folder to keep, ask if you want to respect that choice in the future
9. [ ] Write functionality to restore all deletions from the given run
10. [ ] When moving files into cache, consider possible external drives
    - Can we move somewhere inside that drive
11. [ ] Improve main progress update
12. [x] Where there are too many options to select which one to keep, consider limiting number of options

    ```
    1. a
    2. b
    ...
    12345. i
    ```
