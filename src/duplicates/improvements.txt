0. make the application smart to first load dups.toml and apply any user.dups.toml settings
0. introduce command line parameters which will have the highest priority
0. create new log file for each run
1. show progress during a deletion, how many processed so far (M out of N)
2. during a selection, one a folder selected as keep, it should be respected all the time (without asking)
3. always show paths in a sorted way during deletion
4. anything with (number) as a suffix, can be considered a secondary (if they are reside in the same folder)

    ```
    1: "/Source/Photos from 2017/_DSC5128(1).JPG"
    2: "/Source/Photos from 2017/_DSC5128.JPG"
    ```

5. After selecting a folder to keep, ask if you want to respect that choice in the future
6. Write functionality to restore all deletions from the given run
7. When moving files into cache, consider possible external drives
    - Can we move somewhere inside that drive
8. Improve progress update
9. Where there are too many options to select which one to keep, consider limiting number of options

    ```
    1. a
    2. b
    ...
    12345. i
    ```
